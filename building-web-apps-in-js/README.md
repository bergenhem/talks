# Building a Web App in 100% JavaScript
---

Slides and sample project for my 'Building a Web App in 100% Javascript' talk. Creates a small, but functional application in mostly JavaScript (there is a little HTML). Additional items not covered in the talk (like POST and add support) is available in the source code.

This is possible thanks to the following libraries:

+ Server: [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
+ Web Framework: [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/)
+ Database: [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)
+ ODM & Data Access: [Mongoose.js](http://mongoosejs.com/)
+ UI: [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com/)

This slide deck was created with [Reveal.js.](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) - a pretty neat HTML presentation library.
